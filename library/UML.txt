-   EncodedCircuit: abstract class that defines key fields and methods that need to be declared for each code. 
    Subclasses of this abstract class (which are the circuits with codes) have the particular implementation of the abstract fields
    and methods.
    -   Fields:
        - logical_qubit_count
        - physical_qubit_count
        - logical_qubit_register
        - logical_bit_register
        - logical_quantum_circuit
        - physical_qubit_register
        - physical_bit_register
        - physical_quantum_circuit
    -   Abstract Methods:
        - encode(): initializes the circuit with an encoded state.
        - get_physical_qubits_from_logical(logical_qubit: int): maps a logical qubit to its corresponding physical qubits.
        - x(logical_qubits: list | int): applies Pauli X-gate to certain logical qubits in both logical and physical circuits.
        - y(logical_qubits: list | int): applies Pauli Y-gate to certain logical qubits in both logical and physical circuits.
        - z(logical_qubits: list | int): applies Pauli Z-gate to certain logical qubits in both logical and physical circuits.
        - h(logical_qubits: list | int): applies Hadamard gate to certain logical qubits in both logical and physical circuits.
        - cx(logical_qubits: list | int): applies CNOT gate to a certain logical target qubit from a certain logical control qubit
                                          in both logical and physical circuits.
        - measure_all(): measures the states of qubits of interest in both logical and physical circuits.
        - correct(): applies quantum error correction to a certain operation.
    -   General Methods:
        - barrier(args): applies barrier to separate operations.
        - draw_logical_circuit(output_format): displays logical quantum circuit.
        - draw_physical_circuit(output_format): displays physical quantum circuit.

-   ShorCodeCircuit: subclass of EncodedCircuit that implements the encoding and operations specific to Shor's code.
    -   Fields:
        - (inherits all fields from EncodedCircuit)
    -   Methods:
        - __init__(logical_qubit_count: int, physical_qubits_per_logical: int): initializes logical and physical qubits and circuits.
                                                                                Enables instantation, object creation.
        - (inherits all methods from EncodedCircuit, abstract methods are specified for this particular Code)

-   SteaneCodeCircuit: subclass of EncodedCircuit that implements the encoding and operations specific to Steane code.
    -   Fields:
        - physical_ancilla_qubit_register: QuantumRegister used for performing error correction.
        - physical_measurement_qubit_register: QuantumRegister used for measure the physical qubits.
        - encode_applied: Indicates whether the encoding step has been applied.
        - (inherits all fields from EncodedCircuit)
    -   Methods:
        - __init__(logical_qubit_count: int, physical_qubits_per_logical: int): initializes logical and physical qubits and circuits.
                                                                                Enables instantation, object creation.
        - endoce(re_encode = False): Encodes each logical qubit using the Steane code. Only re-encode is re_encode is set to True.
        - append(U, logical_qubits: list | int): Appends a quantum gate to the logical and physical circuits unless encoding has been applied.
        - append_unitary_error(E, physical_qubits: list | int): Appends an error gate to the specified physical qubits in the physical circuit.
        - (inherits all methods from EncodedCircuit, abstract methods are specified for this particular Code)
